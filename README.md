# Discord-Twitch-STATUS-GLITCH

Steps on how to use this :

## REQUIREMENTS
- 1. You must have NODE.JS COMMAND PROMPT
- 2. You must have DISCORD
- 3. Open the JS.txt File

## STEP 1
Once you open the JS.txt File
There will be a "NAME OF STATUS" and "ANYTHINGGOESHERE"
You may put anything there, NAME OF STATUS indicates what the text will say once you have your twitch status
"ANYTHINGGOESHERE" indicates the unknown twitch if someone decides to click the "watch stream" button.

## STEP 2
In the last section saying "bot.login('TOKEN');
You must need your discord authorization token
Here is a video showcasing how to obtain it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1lzqzLQCs

## STEP 3
Once you've filled everything out in the JS.Txt File,
Change it to a .js file by changing the text file to a .js

## STEP 4
Make a folder for the JS File you've just created,
Open up Node Command Prompt and make sure it's in the correct directory path as your folder,
To do that, type cd FOLDERLINK
to redirect to the folder directory path.

## STEP 5
Once you have it directed to the correct folder path with the JS file,
Type in npm install discord.js

## FINAL STEP
- This will create a package.json file and node modules.

- Once you have done that, all you need to do is run it
by using the command "node NAMEOFFILE.js"

- The result will be a glitched discord twitch status.
